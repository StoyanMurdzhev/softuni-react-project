The SPA is a simple site for sharing recipes. It is built with React, and uses TailwindCSS for styling components.

The project is hosted on Firebase, and uses Firebase's Authentication and Firestore Database services.
Note: since this project is purely for educational purposes, Firebase services like email verification, password changing etc. are disabled. When registering, any made-up email address will work, as long as it is in the correct format.

For testing purposes, three dummy users have been created:
 - dumbledore@hogwarts.edu / password: sherbetlemon
 - kvothe@waystone.inn / password: caesura
 - khriss@silverlight.edu / password: cosmere

Guests can browse the recipes, view the details page for each recipe, or register to the website. 

Once registered or logged in, users gain the ability to post recipes, edit/delete the recipes they have posted, and like the recipes posted by other users.
